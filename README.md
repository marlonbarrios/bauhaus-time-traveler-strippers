## About the Project

**The Bauhaus Time Travelers are Strippers from the Future** is a groundbreaking digital art installation developed by Marlon Barrios Solano. This project speculatively extends into a future where advanced technologies such as quantum computing and hyper-CRISPR AI revolutionize not only art but also the adult entertainment industry. Developed during an artistic and research residency at Lake Studios Berlin in February 2024 and completed at Radiona Maker Space in Zagreb in April 2024, the project integrates web software development, generative AI, immersive soundscapes, and interactive performance art, all housed within a browser-based application.

## Concept

This installation invites users to interact and transform into time travelers themselves, navigating through a "latent space" driven by unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This high-dimensional space allows the AI to generate unpredictable and varied image expressions in real-time, encapsulating data points that cluster based on similarity.

The soundscape of the project is crafted using Musicgen technology, creating a dynamic auditory environment that complements the visual and performative components. Users, depicted as strippers from the future, utilize the application to perform within this latent space, embodying the spirit of Bauhaus artists reimagined as time travelers.

## Themes

The project reinterprets Bauhaus artists as pioneers of time, traversing speculative futures and historical narratives. These time-traveling performers challenge conventional boundaries and explore new realms of artistic expression, engaging with themes of body commodification and the digital gaze, reflecting on the evolution of art and performance in the digital age.

## Objective

**The Bauhaus Time Travelers are Strippers from the Future** serves as a provocative commentary on modern digital cultures, the commodification of bodies, and the intersection of historical artistic movements with futuristic technologies. It challenges viewers to reconsider the boundaries of art, performance, and technology, creating a platform for dialogue about the role of art in society and the potential futures it could help shape.
